In order to make the program work, you must do the following:

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
	1. Generate a binary image for the program provided in the 
		"IAP/IAP_Main/IAP_Binary_Template" project directory. 
	2. Program the internal Flash with the IAP (see below) 
	3. To run the IAP driver, keep the Tamper push-button pressed at Reset. 
		- Open your preferred toolchain
		- Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
		- Run the example
